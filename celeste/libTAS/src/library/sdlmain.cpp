     * so we put the rest of relevent code in the SubSystem function.
     *
     * ...well, this is in theory. If on SDL2 we call SDL_Init(), it
     * does not call our SDL_InitSubSystem() function. Maybe it has to do with
     * some compiler optimization, because the real SDL_Init() function looks
     * like this:
     *      int SDL_Init(Uint32 flags) {
     *          return SDL_InitSubSystem(flags);
     *      }
     * So maybe the compiler is inlining stuff. To fix this, we call
     * ourselves our own SDL_InitSubSystem() function.
     *
     * It seems to be the case with SDL1 for some compiled libraries,
     * so we also call our SDL_InitSubSystem function. This skips some code from
     * SDL_Init but nothing relevant.
