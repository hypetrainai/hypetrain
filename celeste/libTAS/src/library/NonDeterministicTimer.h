/* A simple timer that directly uses the system timer,
 * but is somewhat affected by fast-forward and frame advance.
 * It is not deterministic, but can be a good reference for
 * comparing against what the deterministic timer does.
 * (i.e. run the game first with this to see what the framerate is).
 *
 * If the game runs differently with this timer, then
 * probably this one is doing the more correct behavior,
 * especially if the chosen frame rate is wrong.
 * But many games will be unrecordable while using this timer.
 *
 * To enable this timer, set the framerate to 0.
 *
 * Code largely taken from Hourglass.
