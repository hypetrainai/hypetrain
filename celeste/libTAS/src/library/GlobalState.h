/* We want to store the state of each thread somewhere,
 * to be able to differentiate if some code is being called by the game
 * or by our own program.
 *
 * Indeed, if we use some library that eventually call a function that we hooked,
 * we don't want to process that call in the same way as if the game called that
 * function itself.
 *
 * This is also necessary to avoid some recursive loops.
 * For example, the logging function calls fwrite at some point,
 * so printing a log message inside the hooked fwrite function leads to a loop.
 *
 * This state is different for each thread, so we have to declare an instance
 * using c++11 thread_local.
