P0:
- Message send/recv for frame advance and inputs. In particular the clock_gettime hack needed for Celeste.
- Get pixel data for current frame.
- Separate game interaction into a environment module.

P1:
- Celeste position detector & map scroll tracking system.
- Baseline model interacting with environment with backprop.
- Save/Load states.

P2:
- Environment module should be in its own thread and not interact with each other. LibTAS socket files need to be random tempfiles shared through environ rather than hardcoded /tmp/libTAS.socket.
- Interactive (recording) mode: record the inputs at each frame and generate a file that can then be provided on the command line to "restore" the game at a given position. Useful for getting through game menus to where you want to be at. Only if save states cannot persist between sessions.
