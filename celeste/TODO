P0:
- Separate game interaction into a environment module.
- Support recurrent actor network.

P1:
- Map scroll tracking system.

P2:
- Flow-based actor network.
- Decrease FLAGS.hold_buttons_for on a schedule.
- Environment module should be in its own thread and not interact with each other. LibTAS socket files need to be random tempfiles shared through environ rather than hardcoded /tmp/libTAS.socket.
