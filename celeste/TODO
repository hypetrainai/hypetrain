P0:
- Separate game interaction into a environment module.

P1:
- Map scroll tracking system.
- Baseline model interacting with environment with backprop.

P2:
- Environment module should be in its own thread and not interact with each other. LibTAS socket files need to be random tempfiles shared through environ rather than hardcoded /tmp/libTAS.socket.
